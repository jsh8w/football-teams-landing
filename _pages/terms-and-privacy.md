# Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
Thank you for showing an interest in Teams - Football Widget. I take your privacy very seriously. I neither want nor need to know anything about your personal data. Therefore, the app is built to keep your data completely private.

## Your Privacy
I (James Shaw) built Teams - Football Widget (also termed "the Service", "our Service", or "this Service") as a free app. The app is currently provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This part of the support website is used to inform users about the service's policies on the manner in which the service accesses, uses, stores, or shares user data ("Personal Information").

If you choose to use Teams - Football Widget, then you agree to the request and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that the service requests is used for providing and improving the app. The service will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use
Teams - Football Widget **does not** collect or store any personally identifiable information.

## Football Data Service
Teams - Football Widget uses [Football-Data.org API Services](https://www.football-data.org/) to request Football data. Therefore, by using the service, you are agreeing to be bound by the [Terms of Service](https://www.football-data.org/about) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.football-data.org/about) when engaging football content through the app.

## Premium Purchases
If you sign-up for Teams Premium, either via Subscription or In-App Purchase, your billing information, address, and name are all maintained by the Apple App Store and are not visible to me. I will simply get information about whether or not you have purchased a subscription/in-app purchase, the term you signed up for and when it is due to expire. This is all made available to me in an anonymous fashion. This anonymous data is also shared with my purchase provider [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/dpa).

## Changes to Privacy Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new or updated Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.

## Contact Me
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this privacy policy or the service.
